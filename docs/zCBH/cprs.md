# CPRS

FYI, the Cerner transition has a goal completion date of 2028.

This is a *goal* completion date, and this is a project of the US Government.

CPRS skills are likely to be useful for a good while yet.

## Shortcuts

CPRS has a rather staggering amount of keyboard shortcuts.

The full list is available in this 
[pdf](http://www.va.gov/vdl/documents/Clinical/Comp_Patient_Recrd_Sys_(CPRS)/cprsguium.pdf).

I haven't done much with the full possibilities
of the shortcut workflow - people have written 
little scripts that essentially mash buttons
in particular sequences to, for example,
clear useless alerts 
(e.g. critical lab values from your last ICU shift).

## Task management

One of the beautiful and awful things
about CPRS is that it is self-contained.

It does not interface with the outside world - 
no push notifications, 
no easy way to check things on your phone.

Within its walled garden,
it is also not easy to figure out
what has been done and what needs doing.

There are a few approaches to task management
more-or-less built into CPRS. 

### Tracker Reminder Notes

One of the available note types
is called "Tracker Reminder."
These are unsignable notes (try to sign one and it will fail),
that remain in your inbox until deleted.
They are a great way to prechart,
and you can use them to make notes to yourself about whatever.

No one else, including your preceptor, can see what's in them
(maybe there's some way for some admin to introspect them,
but I haven't heard of anyone who both knows how to do this and cares to look at your personal scribblings).

I used to also use them as a general to-do list,
and I know some residents live by them throughout training.
I don't use them as a catch-all anymore (instead preferring Ticklers, outlined below), 
and now essentially only use them for pre-charting.
In your inbox, 
all you can see is the patient for whom you have a Tracker Reminder,
and the note title ("UNSIGNED Tracker Reminder") - 
there is no good way to differentiate between a precharted note,
a to-do item, 
or anything else you may have written.

CPRS is very slow,
so clicking into each Tracker Reminder 
to see what's in there is much too expensive in terms of time.

### Ticklers

Yes, self-assigned alerts in CPRS are called "Ticklers."
Because "Alerts" is not nearly descriptive enough.

To set up Ticklers for yourself, get into a new note or make an addendum.

(shout out to Paige, RN extraordinaire, for showing me her approach - 
it's A-OK to make an addendum with the content of only "setting alert")

Click "Templates" on the bottom left.
The first "Shared Template" should have the word "Tickler."
Double-click it, 
and it will open up a simple dialogue
that asks you when you want to be alerted,
and any text you would like within the alert.

Then, when the time comes for that alert,
it will show up in your universal CPRS inbox.
When you click into it,
it will show you the text you entered,
and give you three options - 
copy the text of the alert to the clipboard,
renew the alert,
or close it out.

One advantage to this approach over
a huge list of Tracker Reminder notes
is that your inbox does not become nearly as cluttered,
and you can tell more easily what is time-sensitive.
I also prefer it over some third-party solution, 
such as a OneNote page, Word doc, or Excel sheet
(all HIPAA-compliant if using your institutional OneDrive account),
because all of my VA work and data lives in a single system,
so I don't have something else to (forget to) check.

### Leave-one-behind alert method

The most common scenario:
see a patient, order some studies.
Study results roll in, 
you need to discuss next steps with the patient.
Something is still processing, 
and/or you don't have time right now to have a phone call.
Instead of leaving 6 or 7 alerts for the same person cluttering your inbox,
remove all but one 
(highlight the alerts you want to get rid of and click "Remove").
That lone remaining alert functions as a reminder.
When the stars align, click into that alert,
go through all the recent results,
and communicate however makes sense for the situation.

## Remote Access QoL

### Text expansion

One of the best categories of quality-of-life improvements 
you can make for using CPRS remotely
is text expansion/macros.

On Windows, PhraseExpress is great. 
On Mac, aText is also great.

Set up an expansion to [enter your passcode (123456) and hit "Enter"].

I have it set to `,c`. (I have `,e` mapped to my Epic password).

This saves so much time and hassle. 
For example, to sign a note, 
I hit `Ctrl+Shift+g` to open the "Sign Note" dialog (this is a built-in CPRS shortcut),
then I tap `,c`, and the note is signed.
Takes far less than a second, 
fingers stay close to home row.

The VA made their own tool to do this,
called "CPRSBooster" (it's somewhere under the Star folder on every desktop).
It works.

The main utility of CPRSBooster 
is to give you ideas for other text expansions you could set up,
such as your nurse's name for tagging on notes.

## VistA

VistA is the (rather insane) software and database system that undergirds CPRS.
I get the sense that the deepest magicks rest in VistA, 
waiting for the intrepid explorer,
seeking a grail filled with 
automated data extraction and sane clinical workflows.

The documentation is scattered. 
[This](https://www.va.gov/vdl/) is one of the official sources.
I've only taken a cursory look, but it seems less technical and mostly snarky.

There's also a [wiki](http://www.vistapedia.com/index.php/Main_Page#VistApedia) devoted to VistA,
though it is not restricted to the official USGovt version
(since the software is federally mandated to be open source,
it has been forked and developed in several countries worldwide).

If you have been inducted into the cult of VistA,
and need an acolyte,
let me know.
I make pretty kickass chocolate chip cookies.
